# Cab-Booking-Service-Demo
This is a demo app for cab booking service

There are three layers in the app:

1) Controller layer -> This layer talks to the other two layers and decides which methods to call and with what parameters.

2) Service layer -> This layer has the implementation of the business logic.

3) Model layer -> This layer stores the entities and the data we use in this demo app.
